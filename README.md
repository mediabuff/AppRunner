### AppRunner

A simple, WTL based, shortcut utility app.

The shortcuts are grouped in pages and (optionally) separated by separator lines. Each shortcut may point to an application with optional command line arguments, a file which is opened by the registered app, or a folder which opens a file manager with the folder selected. The pages and shortcuts are defined in a simple xml file (see AppRunner.xml for an example).
